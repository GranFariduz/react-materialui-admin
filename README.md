# Getting started with react-materialui-admin

This project is a starter kit for making an admin panel, made with React, TypeScript and Material UI.

# What's included?

You get out of the box implementation of TypeScript, react-hook-form, some utilities like a global loader and a wrapper around axios which makes it a bit easier to use. You also get a sample Global State Provider using Context API, custom theming on Material UI and a few customised components like Navbar, Sidebar and a Modal.

## Scripts available for you

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
